## Gendered Nouns
Here are the key points rephrased:

1. English language does not have inherently gendered nouns like Spanish or German.
2. However, certain words are associated with gender, such as "stewardess" and "fireman."
3. There is a growing trend to move away from gendered terms and adopt gender-neutral alternatives.
4. Examples of gender-neutral terms:
   - Firefighter instead of fireman/firewoman
   - Flight attendant instead of steward/stewardess
   - Server instead of waiter/waitress
   - Salesperson instead of salesman/saleswoman
5. Formerly masculine terms like "teacher," "editor," and "soldier" are now used for all genders.
Instead of

| Men | Women |
| --- | --- |
| Teacher | Teacheress |
| Editor | Editrix |
| Soldier | Soldieress |

6. The term "actor" is increasingly preferred over "actress" in the industry.(Often Gender Neutral)
7. Paired gendered words like "husband/wife," "brother/sister," "niece/nephew," and "king/queen" are still common.
8. Some prefer gender-neutral alternatives like "spouse," "sibling," "nibbling," and "monarch."

| Gendered | Gender Neutral |
| --- | --- |
| Husband, Wife | Spouse |
| Brother, Sister | Sibling |
| Nephew, Niece | Nibling |
| King, Queen | Monarch |

9. The choice of language depends on the audience and context.
10. Using gender-neutral nouns promotes inclusivity and avoids sounding outdated or old-fashioned.

## Gerunds
- A gerund is a type of verb that acts like a noun.
- Gerunds end with ing, and like regular nouns, they name a thing and can fill many different roles in a sentence.
- Example: Baking
    - Baking is maria's favorite activity at the store (_Subject_)
    - She loves baking (_Object of verb_)
    - She might get bored if it weren't for the baking (_Object of preposition_)
- Using Possessives with Gerunds:
   - It is generally preferred to use a possessive (his, her, their) before a gerund.
   - Example: "Maria appreciates his singing." (Correct)
   - Example: "Maria appreciates him singing." (Incorrect)
   - This is because gerunds act like nouns, and we use possessives before nouns.
     (e.g., "Maria appreciates his voice.")
- Identifying Gerunds:
   - Words ending with "-ing" are not always gerunds.
   - To identify a gerund, check if the "-ing" word is functioning as a noun in the sentence.
   - Example: "She is baking a cake." (Baking is not a gerund here, but a present participle verb.)
- Importance of Using Possessives:
   - Using a possessive before a gerund is a common convention in English.
   - Failing to use a possessive before a gerund may be seen as an error by some.
   - It is a quirky rule, but following it can make your writing more grammatically correct.

1. **Gerund Definition:**
   - A gerund is a verb form that functions as a noun in a sentence.
   - Gerunds end with "-ing" (e.g., baking, singing, running).

   - Like regular nouns, gerunds can name a thing or action.
   - Gerunds can take different roles in a sentence, just like nouns.
   - Example: "Baking is Maria's favorite activity at the store."
     (Baking acts as a noun, similar to a concrete noun like "scones.")

3. **Using Possessives with Gerunds:**
   - It is generally preferred to use a possessive (his, her, their) before a gerund.
   - Example: "Maria appreciates his singing." (Correct)
   - Example: "Maria appreciates him singing." (Incorrect)

     (e.g., "Maria appreciates his voice.")

4. **Identifying Gerunds:**
   - Words ending with "-ing" are not always gerunds.
   - To identify a gerund, check if the "-ing" word is functioning as a noun in the sentence.
   - Example: "She is baking a cake." (Baking is not a gerund here, but a present participle verb.)

Remember, gerunds are verb forms that act as nouns in a sentence, ending with "-ing." It is generally recommended to use a possessive (his, her, their) before a gerund, just as you would before a regular noun.
