# Verbs
- A verb is a word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being.
- Verbs express physical actions (run, jump, write), mental processes (think, believe, understand), or states of being (am, is, are, were).
- Every sentence must contain at least one verb to be complete.
- Verbs change their form to indicate tense (present, past, future), person (I, you, he/she/it), and number (singular, plural).
- There are different types of verbs like action verbs (walk, play), stative verbs (know, want), transitive verbs (kick the ball), intransitive verbs (arrive, sleep), and more.
- Auxiliary verbs like "be", "have", "will" are used with main verbs to form tenses, aspects, moods, etc.
- Some examples:
  - She sings beautifully. (action verb)
  - I am a student. (state of being verb)
  - They have finished their work. (with auxiliary verb)
  - The baby is sleeping. (stative verb)

## Types of verbs: Action and linking

1. **Importance of Verbs:**
   - Every sentence must have at least one verb.
   - Verbs are essential words that express actions, occurrences, or states of being.
   - The shortest possible sentences can be a single verb, like "Go," "Run," etc.

2. **Types of Verbs:**
   - There are many types of verbs, but we will focus on two main types: action verbs and linking verbs.

3. **Action Verbs:**
   - Action verbs describe actions or activities.
   - Examples: read, watch, learn, eat, run.
   - Action verbs are modified by adverbs.
     Example: "You read well." (well is an adverb modifying the action verb read)

4. **Linking Verbs (State of Being Verbs):**
   - Linking verbs connect the subject to a state of being or description.
   - The most common linking verb is the verb "to be" (is, am, are, was, were).
   - Example: "Maria is happy." (is links Maria to the state of being happy)

5. **Verbs with Both Meanings:**
   - Some verbs, like sensing verbs (smell, feel), can be both action verbs and linking verbs.
   - The type of word used with the verb determines its meaning.
   - Example: "Rover smells badly." (badly is an adverb, so smells is an action verb)
   - Example: "Rover smells bad." (bad is an adjective, so smells is a linking verb)

6. **Identifying Linking Verbs:**
   - To identify a linking verb, try replacing it with a form of the verb "to be."
   - If the sentence still makes sense, it is likely a linking verb.
   - Example: "Rover smells bad" can be rephrased as "Rover is bad" (smells is a linking verb).

7. **Modifying Verbs:**
   - Linking verbs are modified by adjectives, describing the subject's state.
   - Action verbs are modified by adverbs, describing how the action is performed.
   - Example: "You feel bad" (feel is a linking verb, bad is an adjective describing your state).
